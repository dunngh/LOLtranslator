This is a program to take a .lol file of LOLCODE source and translate it into an output file of C++ code and compile it.

This is only the beginning. Some keywords do not follow spec. Most keywords have not been programmed yet.

A note on variable declaration:
  As of right now, all variables are to be called VAR and there will only be one variable 
  allowed. This one variable will be a double float. This will change some tim in the
  future to allow real variables of varying type and name.
